# How to create a theme

### Create a custom theme


To create a theme we provide a [simple utility tool coming](https://github.com/vaemendis/hccd). 
We included the jar in the [card-maker directory](https://github.com/kids-code-games/variables-war/tree/master/card-maker) not to have to manage different version of the tool.

- copy paste one of the directory under card-marker and give it a new name
- this directory should contains few files: cards.css cards.csv cards.html
- to generate the web page, launch the utility jar:   java -jar ./Hccd.jar
- using the 'open' button, select the html file of your new created folder

Alternatively, you can any other runtime to generate cards, the only requirement is to provide everything we need to update the deck by ourself.

### How to public a theme
