### The rules

TODO

5 categories of cards: 
* *value*: used to increase or decrease the value of a Var, remember the goal is to reach exactly 42 point.

* *loop*: repeat the next card to be played on a variable, you will need them to go reach faster 42 or you can use them on their opponents to redeuce their score.

* *attacks*: freeze var, slow down speed or add requirements to your opponent stack. When you will have play several time you will eventually find some good opportunities to some on them on yourself.

* *defense*: Memory leak, refatoring or firewall, different way to counter attacks. Some of them will allow you to rewrite the history of you favorite variable.

* *bonus*: Game changer cards! You will definitively love those ones!

The complete list of cards is [available on this page](./CardsDescription.md).
